# Flutter UI (Learning Platform)

This project is a personal UI practice in Flutter, focusing on creating an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly application interface. 

## Inspiration

The UI design was inspired by a [Dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/7728855-Youth-Education-Launch-Login-Page) which depicts an elegant and youthful design for an education app's login page.
